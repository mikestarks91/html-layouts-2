		<h1>Type Something</h1>
		<p>If you've ever read a book you've liked, you know that reading can be a pretty good way to open your mind up to new ideas. Books push your brain to work at a concept, to struggle a little bit to achieve comprehension. They help you learn to think in different terms than you did before. And if you don't read very often, it takes a long time to adapt.</p>
		<p>As a kid, I remember how I used to get excited at the prospect of going to see a new action film, or even plopping down in front of the ancient tube TV to watch cartoons. The constant, overwhelming stimuli of TV is perfect for when you're trying to drown out the ache of boredom, and the frustration of obstacles and struggle. It's easy, cheap entertainment, and I had a hard time taking my eyes off the screen.</p>
		<p>Around the age of 6, my parents gave up cable TV entirely (ostensibly because of the expense, and also because my mom hated it). I was forced to either watch movies we had on vhs or to go outside and experience something fresh and real. I usually picked the former. Even if it meant watching the same movie more than once a week, you could usually find me flopped across the couch, marinating in my own perspiration as I sat counting down the movie trailers until the words <em>'And now, for our feature presentation'</em> came booming through the speakers. I've watched those trailers so many times, I remember them almost as well as the movies.</p>

		<p>Movies have improved a lot visually and auditorily since those days, and today I still find it highly stimulating to go bury my ass in a movie theatre seat and flood my senses with carefully manufactured sounds and visuals that evoke almost every emotion I'm aware of having: hunger, lust, love, hatred, compassion, sadism, melancholy, bitterness, fear, anxiety, disgust, and even at times serenity. But in all of this I am starting to feel a growing impotence; I've forgotten how to entertain myself.</p>
		<p>That's where we're going wrong in this century. We're losing the ability to struggle through boredom and ignorance and open up our minds to an unfamiliar concept, a new sensation, an empowering skill. We look to our friends on tired weekends and agree to live out the same boring, pre-fabricated activities in search of yesterday's thrill. It's a cycle of safety and comfort that leads to ineptitude, to eventual failure. We can't continue being the same things forever; we have to adapt. And if we lose that ability, we're faced only with the grim prospect of our eventual disintegration as we live out lives of dull repetition.</p>
